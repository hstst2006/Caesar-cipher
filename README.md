#Caesar cipher
##How it works
The Caesar cipher works by using a value (key) and shifting the values of
 a string up or down based on this key. 
 This program uses the values from the ASCII table to perform this action.
##Navigating the user interface
###To encrypt something enter 1.
Enter a value (key) for the program to use while encrypting.
Then enter the sentence you want to encrypt.
Press any key when you are done looking at your message to return to the main menu.
_**NB: This will clear the terminal (on windows, at least).**_
 
###To decrypt something enter 2.
Enter a value (key) for the program to use while decrypting.
Then enter the sentence you want to decrypt.
Press any key when you are done reading the decrypted message to return to the main menu.
_**NB: This will clear the terminal (on windows, at least)**_
 
###To quit the program enter 3.
This option exits the program.
 
##Hopes and dreams:
Change the hardcoded character limit (of 256) to something more flexible

Add option to read and write to file.
